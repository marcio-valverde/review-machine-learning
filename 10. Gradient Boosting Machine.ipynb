    "# Introduction: Gradient Boosting Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Sources: [Tree Boosting with XGBoost](https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2433761/16128_FULLTEXT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), [Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf), and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)\n",

    "The gradient boosting machine is an ensemble machine learning model that has risen to prominence in recent years due to exceptional performance on structured machine learning tasks. The gradient boosting machine not surprisingly is a boosting model, one of the two types of ensembles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bagging (bootstrap aggregating): train individual learners independently and make a prediction by averaging individual predictions\n",
    "* boosting: train individual learners in sequence, with each individual learning from the mistakes of the previous. Predictions are made by weighting the predictions inversely proportional to the error of the individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling notebook showed examples of both ensembles: random forest and extra trees are bagging methods while AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) is a boosting ensemble. Whereas in adaptive boosting, the observations are re-weighted each iteration according to the magnitude of their residuals (with larger residuals receiving greater weight), in gradient boosting, the learners are trained directly on the residuals of the entire ensemble. Both methods are teaching each successive learner to focus on the errors of the previous learners, but using different methods. Furthermore, while adaptive boosting weights the individuals according to their performance on the training set, the contribution of each learner in gradient boosting is learned through an iterative gradient descent optimization method. The ultimate goal of machine learning is to approximate a function that maps the features to the targets, and gradient boosting can therefore be thought of as gradient descent in function space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a general method that can be applied to any differentiable objective function and use any individual models (called weak learners). The most common weak learner is the decision tree leading to particular type of gradient boosting known as Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). There are several open-source libraries for implementing Gradient Boosting in Python including [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [LightGBM](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [CatBoost](https://catboost.yandex/). Although Scikit-Learn is a go-to library for many machine learning algorithms, its version of the Gradient Boosting model is [less performant](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10943/why-is-xgboost-so-much-faster-than-sklearn-gradientboostingclassifier) with fewer customizations than the other options. In this notebook, we will implement a gradient boosting machine using the [LightGBM library](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) from Microsoft. This library includes a number of variations on the gradient boosting framework including [Dropout meets Multiple Addivive Regression Trees (DART)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01866) and [Gradient-based One Sided Sampling (GOSS)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf). We will stick to using the Gradient Boosting Regression Trees method. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover some of the best practices for building a gradient boosting machine collected from multiple machine learning competitions and published research. We will put these practices to use by building a gradient boosting model step by step for the supervised regression building energy prediction problem. The end outcome is a function that will allow us to evaluate the gradient boosting machine alongside the other models developed in the [Modeling notebook](https://bitbucket.org/willkoehrsen/prediction-documentation/src/670f76b3c327aed7916cd2d73f3f84dec8d71c98/notebooks/Modeling.ipynb?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default). These models will be tested on hundreds of building datasets to determine the most promising model for further development. "

In this notebook, and for evaluation of all buildings, we will use a standard set of hyperparameters (for all but one of the settings) selected by analyzing best practices recommended by research papers and the documentation for the library. Moreover, we will use early stopping to determine one of the most important hyperparameters, the number of decision trees trained (this is also known as the number of boosting rounds or the number of iterations). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Boosting Machine Hyperparameters \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sets of hyperparameters in a gradient boosting machine: those that apply to the overall ensemble, and those that apply to the individual learners in the ensemble. These hyperparameters are used to control the bias/variance tradeoff: higher variance leads to overfitting while high bias leads to underfitting. Both situations decrease generalization performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main hyperparameters that pertain to the entire ensemble are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_estimators`: number of base learners used, equivalently the number of boosting rounds. More estimators decreases the bias but increases the variance which can lead to overfitting. This hyperparameter can be set using early stopping. \n",
    "* `learning_rate`: the contribution of each new learner to the ensemble. A larger learning rate will increase the rate of convergence but may lead the algorithm to jump around the optimum (lowest point) of the objective function. A lower learning rate will lead to longer training times but can improve generalization on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other hyperparameters that deal with the entire model. However, we will only set one other different than the default:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `subsample`: the fraction of observations to use for training each base learner. By default the GBM uses all of the training examples, but by randomly samping a subset of the observations, the variance of the model can be reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following set of ensemble hyperparameters (all others are kept at the defaults):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_estimators=10000`: this number of base learners will likely not be reached because of early stopping\n",
    "* `learning_rate=0.01`: This is a decrease of three-quarters from the default of 1.0\n",
    "* `subsample=0.9`: sample 90% of the training examples for training\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of estimators will not actually be 10,000 for many of the training runs because we will use early stopping to determine the ideal value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping continues adding learners to the ensemble until the error on a validation set has not decreased for a set number of iterations. For example, here we will use early stopping by adding more learners until the MAPE on the validation set has not decreased for 100 iterations. The model records the number of estimators that resulted in the lowest error and then this number of estimators is used to make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of early stopping is illustrated in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../images/early_stopping.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is an effective technique for choosing the ideal number of base learners and is commonly used for training gradient boosting machines. Early stopping greatly simplifies the process of finding the optimal number of iterations. Using early stopping does require a validation set though, which reduces the amount of training data. However, we can get around this limitation by selecting the number of iterations using the technique of cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation (cv) is another best practice in machine learning. Often, the ideal model hyperparameters require a validation set to determine. The validation set must be drawn from the __training data__ and not the testing data. Splitting the training data into two sets though reduces the amount of training data, which can have a detrimental effect on performance. Moreover, optimizing the hyperparameters for a single validation set can just lead to overfitting on the _validation data_. Therefore, a technique known as cross-validation is used to avoid the need for a separate validation set and to better predict the generalization error of the model. The most common implementation of cross validation is K-Fold Cross Validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In K-Fold cross validation, the training data is split into K folds and then training proceeds in an iterative manner. On each iteration, the model is trained on K-1 of the sets and tested on the Kth set. This continues for K iterations until eventually all of the training data has been used as a validation set. The final estimate of the performance of the model is the average performance across the K validation scores. This method eliminates the need to split the valuable training data and usually provides a better measure of the generalization performance than using one validation set. The final model is then trained on the entire training data before making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an image of using 5-fold cv:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../images/5-fold.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/429451/k-fold-cross-validation-figure-using-tikz-or-table)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use K-Fold cross validation in order to determine the ideal number of base learners. We will split the data into 5 folds, and each fold, train until the MAPE on the validation fold does not decrease for 100 iterations. Each iteration, the best number of learners is recorded, and the final number of learners used is the average of the best number from the 5 validation runs. After completing 5-fold cv, the model is trained on the entire set of training data using the optimal number of iterations. Ideally this procedure will find a near-optimal number of iterations that will result in high generalization performance on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "While K-Fold cv can be used to select the number of estimators, the other hyperparameters will have to be set at a constant value for all of the evaluation. The other main hyperparameter governing the entire model is the learning rate which will be set at 0.01. Generally, a smaller learning rate is used to complement a larger number of estimators. The maximum number of estimators is 10000, and although this number likely will not be reached because of early stopping, the learning rate is set at 0.01 to prevent the model from \"jumping\" around the optimum value of the objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization and Individual Learner Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting Machine can be regularized both on the ensemble level and the base learner level. To regularize the model on the ensemble level, the number of estimators can be reduced. On the individual learner level, there are a number of hyperparameters that can be adjusted. We can limit the complexity of each tree by limiting the maximum depth, establishing a minimum number of observations required in each leaf node, or limiting the maximum number of leaf nodes among other methods. We can also penalize the complexity of the trees by adding terms to the objective function proportional to the L1 and L2 norm of the weights of the tree. We will impose regularization on the individual learners by setting the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `reg_alpha=0.1`: Penalty on L1 norm of the tree weights\n",
    "* `reg_lambda=0.1`: Penality on L2 norm of the tree weights\n",
    "\n",
    "The final hyperparameters we set in the call to the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_jobs=-1`: Use all available cores on the machine for training\n",
    "\n",
    "__All of the rest of the hyperparamters are set at the defaults.__ These defaults should be reviewed and can be [ound in the documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-API.html#scikit-learn-api)"

    "Machine learning is often criticized as a black box: we put in some data and recieve answers - often extremely accurate answers - with no explanations. One method we can use to peer into the black box of gradient boosting machines are feature importances. For a gradient boosting model based on individual decision trees, the [feature importances represent the decrease in impurity from including the feature in the model](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15810339/how-are-feature-importances-in-randomforestclassifier-determined). The absolute value of the feature importances can be [difficult to interpret](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4928-understanding-variable-importances-in-forests-of-randomized-trees.pdf), but the relative magnitude of the importances can be used to determine which features the model considers \"most important\". \n",

    "We want to avoid reading too much into the metrics at this point, but the Gradient Boosting Machine looks as if it may compete. The difficult part of determining the real \"best\" model is the influence of the hyperparameters. The best model/settings probably is different for every building and optimizing all the models would require an extensive search procedure. For now we will have to be content with selecting a set of hyperparameters and using those for the model on each building. "

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The [gradient boosting machine](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vip/teach/MLcourse/4_boosting/slides/gradient_boosting.pdf) is a powerful boosting ensemble machine learning model. While it has many hyperparameters to tune, the high performance more than makes up for the development time. In this notebook, we walked through am implementation of the gradient boosting machine for the building energy prediction task. The model uses cross validation to find the optimal number of base learners and is built using a sensible set of additional hyperparameters. We stepped through the process of building the model, tuning the number of iterations using cross validation, fitting the optimal model, making predictions with the model, and evaluating the model predictions. Preliminary results from two buildings suggest the Gradient Boosting Machine is competitive with the bagging, tree-based ensemble models in Scikit-Learn although more data is needed to draw significant conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in this notebook we saw how we can use feature importances to try and understand how the model makes predictions. Model interpretation will be a focus of a later notebook, but this is one technique we may be able to employ ([Local-Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME)](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/introduction-to-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime) is another tool). The next step is to evaluate all of the models developed on hundreds of buildings to gather enough data to make significant conclusions. After evaluation, the best model can be selected for optimization through hyperparameter tuning. Then, we can make efforts to try and explain the predictions of the model. It's one thing to know a machine learning model can make accurate predictions but another problem entirely to understand how the model makes predictions. I will see you in the next notebook!"
